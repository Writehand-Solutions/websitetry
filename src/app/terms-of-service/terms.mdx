In the event of a change to the MAP, you are responsible for ensuring your continued compliance with the MAP Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, We may run special pricing offers, promotions, or discounts from time-to-time (“Special Pricing”). Our use of Special Pricing does not create an exception to the MAP Policy. Any changes to this MAP Policy will be communicated by a change to these Terms or by other forms of communication deemed appropriate by Company in its sole discretion.

b. Advertised Price and Final Sale Price.   The price at which you are advertising access to the Services is determined after deduction of coupon discounts, rebates, value of product giveaways, gift card amounts, and other promotional offers, that have the effect of lowering an advertised price (“Advertised Price”).

a. Company reserves the right to make exceptions to this MAP Policy at any time, for any reason, in its sole and absolute discretion. Such exceptions must be made in writing, and may be revoked by Company at any time, for any reason, in its sole and absolute discretion.

b. This MAP Policy does not apply to advertising within any jurisdiction in which minimum advertised price policies are prohibited by law. It is a violation of this policy, however, to transmit an Advertised Price less than the MAP Policy from any such jurisdiction to customers in any jurisdiction in which the MAP Policy is permissible.

c. For sales into the European Union and United Kingdom, this MAP Policy does not prohibit you from offering Customers discounts or communicating to customers that the Final Price could differ from the Advertised Price.

e. You Must Not Represent Yourself as Productised.  You are prohibited from representing yourself as an Productised employee or otherwise implying an association with Productised when reselling access to the Services.

Any contractual relationship existing with Respondents is entered into between you and them. You are fully responsible for meeting any applicable obligations when contacting Respondents and processing their data.

k) Compliance with our requests

l) Third Party Provision of Artificial Intelligence Functionality

In order to provide the Artificial Intelligence (AI) functionality we require the collaboration of Open AI. You hereby acknowledge that Open AI is not an affiliate, partner, agent or representative to us. We do not make any guarantees, representations or warranties of any kind to you regarding the availability of the Open AI service that supports the AI functionality. We disclaim any liability for any third-party IP, including their accuracy, integrity, quality, legality, usefulness or safety, or any intellectual property rights therein. The availability of any third-party IP does not imply our endorsement or affiliation with any provider of such third-party IP and does not create any legal relationship between such provider and you.

You are solely responsible for your use of all aspects of the Services that leverage technology provided by Open AI, and any losses or liabilities of any kind associated with that use. You shall comply with all rights, obligations, conditions, policies, laws and regulations pertaining to such third-party IP. You shall defend us, indemnify us and hold us harmless from and against any and all losses, settlements, damages, liabilities, judgments, obligations, fines or sanctions, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) (collectively “Losses”), arising out of any claim, proceeding, demand, suit or action (collectively “Actions”) brought by a third party related to your use of the Services that leverages functionality provided by Open AI.
We do not have access to your Open AI API keys. Once integrated, Your API keys from the Open AI API are encrypted immediately using encryption protocols that conform with industry best practices. This measure is designed to help protect your API keys and ensures that they are securely stored and transmitted.
By using Productised, you agree as well to comply with all Open AI terms and conditions, which can be found here, respectively, including any restrictions on use contained therein. You acknowledge that data you provide to Open AI through the Services may be used to train and improve their Generative Artificial Intelligence systems, including the GPT 4 model. Our systems have been designed however to ensure data submitted to our forms is not used for model training purposes as it is processed via the OpenAI API, which has been declared by OpenAI as a route that bypasses their model training.

5. Fees and payments

Payment for the Services shall be subject to the following payment terms and conditions:

a. Fees

All fees for paid subscriptions are invoiced in advance, with monthly or annual frequency, depending on the subscription period chosen, unless otherwise provided for in an Order Form or Statement of Work executed by the parties. Fees may be subject to change from time to time. New charges will be levied following the provision of written notice to you via the Site, Services and/or email. By continuing to use the Services following any fee increase you shall thereby be bound by the new or increased charges. You agree and acknowledge that fees will be billed to the credit card we have on file for your account and credit or debit card is the payment method to be used absent written agreement with You to the contrary. Fees will be billed to the credit card we have on file.   You agree to provide us with accurate and complete billing information (name, address, credit card information, and phone number) and notify us of any changes within 7 calendar days of the change.

Payments are processed by Stripe, our designated payment processor that has attained certification to PCI Level 1. This means we are not permitted to access or store Your payment information in any form. You agree and acknowledge that by providing your credit or debit card you are authorizing the charging of the card provided on a recurring basis to collect all Fees due. Updating of payment method details is Your sole responsibility and you must ensure details are accurate, complete and up-to-date. You acknowledge that failure to do so may lead to suspension or termination of your account.

You hereby indemnify Us for all Claims related to Taxes that are associated with your activities using the Services, including any Taxes associated with Your transactions with customers as further outlined below.

You hereby authorize us to continue charging your card for the Subscription Fees as they fall due using the updated information. In the event of payment failure, we reserve the right to retry the card we have on file. If a payment is not successfully authorized because of expiration, insufficient funds or otherwise we may suspend or terminate your subscription to the Services.

Should you avail yourself of the upgrade functionality in the Services you acknowledge this represents express authorization from you to charge your account the difference between your current subscription charge and the subscription tier you are upgrading to, prorated to the remaining days of your Subscription Period. The paid subscription tier you have upgraded to will then be billed for on a monthly recurring basis.

Except for those cases in which the content at issue could give rise to Us being liable for breach of applicable law or when it is necessary to act swiftly in the interests of prevention of harm to a particular individual, we will provide you with reasonable advance notice regarding our intentions and give you sufficient time to take corrective action. 

Your account will be terminated should you fail to rectify a substantive breach of these Terms for a period greater than 14 days, following the provision of breach notification to you.

The agreement is immediately terminable by either party if the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.

Should your account remain inactive for a period exceeding 12 (twelve) months we reserve the right to terminate it. This is to ensure that Service bandwidth is provided only to active users and the Services remain speedy and effective.

Please note that in all these cases you may lose all the information stored in your Account, such as surveys and responses.
